# AGENTIK™

Local-first agent orchestration platform — built to run on your hardware, keep data on-device, and ship automations fast.

Repository: Constellation25/agentik  
Web UI: product/web/index.html  
Installer: install.sh

## Why AGENTIK™?

Most AI platforms:
- charge per token / per seat
- move your data off-device
- lock you into proprietary ecosystems

AGENTIK™:
- runs on your hardware
- keeps data local-first
- stays modular, composable, scriptable

> Philosophy: You own your compute. You own your data. You own your AI.

## Git Rules (YesQuid Pro)

Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:  
Branches: main, develop, feature/*, fix/*

---

## Embedded Repo Warning (Important)

If you see:

warning: adding embedded git repository

It means a folder inside this repo contains its own .git directory.

This repo ships with a guard that:
- removes that folder from the Git index (if tracked)
- ignores that path so it won't become a submodule by accident

Manual fix:

git rm -r --cached <folder>
